### Secret Keys

Secret keys are generated into this folder. Do not publicize the keys that are generated - each key enables a voter to vote.

Publicizing all of the keys that are generated would allow a single person to cast all of the votes.

The agent in charge of the election should secretly distribute one of these keys to each voter.

The owners of this repository humbly suggest that each voter be sent a floppy disk with a randomly selected key via registered mail requiring a signature.

The election can be fully anonymous if the agent in charge of the election uses double blind procedures and is not aware which key is sent to each voter. 
So long as each voter gets exactly one key, there is no difference between keys or any motivation for sending any given voter a specific key (unless the 
agent in charge explicitly wants to retain this information in order to track how each individual vote is cast).
